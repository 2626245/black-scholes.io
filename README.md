# 🧠 Black-Scholes Option Pricing App

This is a full-stack educational web application designed to **predict European option prices** using the **Black-Scholes model**. It leverages machine learning techniques (specifically **Artificial Neural Networks**) and incorporates the theoretical foundations of option pricing models.

## 📈 About the Model

The **Black-Scholes formula** is one of the most widely used models for pricing derivatives. However, like many financial models, it is built on a set of simplifying assumptions that may not hold in real markets.

### ⚙️ Model Assumptions

This implementation assumes the following:
- The underlying asset follows **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**.
- There is **no arbitrage** opportunity in the market.
- The option is **European-style** (can only be exercised at maturity).
- The asset has **constant volatility** (or volatility as a function of moneyness and time).
- The risk-free interest rate is constant.
- The market is frictionless (no transaction costs).
- The dividend yield `q` is set to **0** for simplicity.

### 📐 The Black-Scholes Equation

The price of a **call option** under the Black-Scholes model is given by:

#### Equation 5-1:

\[
C = S e^{-qτ} Φ(d_1) - e^{-rτ} K Φ(d_2)
\]

where:

\[
d_1 = \frac{\ln(S/K) + (r - q + \frac{σ^2}{2}) τ}{σ\sqrt{τ}}, \quad
d_2 = d_1 - σ\sqrt{τ}
\]

To simplify, we use:

- **Moneyness**: \( M = \frac{K}{S} \)
- **Dividend yield**: \( q = 0 \)

### ✅ Simplified Equation:

\[
C = Φ\left(\frac{-\ln(M)+(r+\frac{σ^2}{2})τ}{σ\sqrt{τ}}\right) - M e^{-rτ} Φ\left(\frac{-\ln(M)+(r-\frac{σ^2}{2})τ}{σ\sqrt{τ}}\right)
\]

This form highlights that **moneyness**, **volatility**, and **time to maturity** are key factors.

## 📊 Volatility Surface Assumption

Since volatility is not constant in real markets, we simulate it using a **volatility surface**. The assumed structure is:

#### Equation 5-2:

\[
σ(M, τ) = σ₀ + ατ + β(M - 1)^2
\]

Where:
- \( M \): Moneyness
- \( τ \): Time to maturity
- \( σ₀, α, β \): Constants controlling base level and curvature of the surface

This captures **volatility smiles/skews**, which are observed in real options markets.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Implementation

We train an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to learn the option pricing function.

### Model Training:
- Implemented in **Jupyter Notebook**
- Data can be:
  - **Real-world options data**
  - **Synthetic data**, based on the simplified Black-Scholes formula  
    > To use synthetic data, **uncomment the relevant code block** in the notebook

### Inputs:
- Moneyness (M)
- Time to maturity (τ)
- Volatility (σ)

### Output:
- Predicted option price (C)
